# Dino Reinforcement Learning

This project explores using reinforcement learning to train an agent to play the chrome Dino Game

## Single-Threaded Version

The single-threaded implementation achieved the following results:

- **At 100k iterations**: It was capable of recognizing the cactuses and jumping. Highscore: 450
- **At 250k iterations**: It was capable of going until stopped. Highscore: 2025

## Performance and Runtime

Training was conducted on my desktop with an RTX 3070 Ti. The training time was approximately 10 hours per 100k iterations.

## How to Run This Yourself

Frankly, I doubt anyone cares enough to do so, but I will include this nonetheless.
